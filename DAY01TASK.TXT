	Blog about objects and its internal representation in  Javascript.
•	Objects, in JavaScript it is most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

•	objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

•	For Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.

•	Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:

var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;

blog about difference between http1.1&http2

http1.1

•	ssl is not required however its recommended
•	slow encryption 
•	one client - server request per TCP connection 
•	no header compression 
•	there is no flow priority 

http2

•	ssl is not required but it is recommended
•	faster encryption
•	multi-master multiplexer . occurs on multiple computers at a single time 
•	metadata compression using improved algorithms that improve performance and security
•	improved flow priority mechanisms are used
